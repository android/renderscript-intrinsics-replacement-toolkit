 * A collection of high-performance graphic utility functions like blur and blend.
 *
 * This toolkit provides ten image manipulation functions: blend, blur, color matrix, convolve,
 * histogram, histogramDot, lut, lut3d, resize, and YUV to RGB. These functions execute
 * multithreaded on the CPU.
 *
 * These functions work over raw byte arrays. You'll need to specify the width and height of
 * the data to be processed, as well as the number of bytes per pixel. For most use cases,
 * this will be 4.
 *
 * You should instantiate the Toolkit once and reuse it throughout your application.
 * On instantiation, the Toolkit creates a thread pool that's used for processing all the functions.
 * You can limit the number of pool threads used by the Toolkit via the constructor. The pool
 * threads are destroyed once the Toolkit is destroyed, after any pending work is done.
 *
 * This library is thread safe. You can call methods from different pool threads. The functions will
 * execute sequentially.
 *
 * A Java/Kotlin Toolkit is available. It calls this library through JNI.
 *
 * This toolkit can be used as a replacement for most RenderScript Intrinsic functions. Compared
 * to RenderScript, it's simpler to use and more than twice as fast on the CPU. However RenderScript
 * Intrinsics allow more flexibility for the type of allocation supported. In particular, this
 * toolkit does not support allocations of floats.
